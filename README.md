Challenge
=========

•	Fill a list (use whatever enumerable you would like Collection, Array, etc.) with random integers ranging 1 to 100
•	Assign each of the items in the list a color Red, Yellow, White.  This is based on position 1 = Red, 2 = Yellow, 3 = White, and repeat (4 = Red, 5 = Yellow, etc.)
•	Remove all of the even numbers that are red.  Remove all of the odd numbers that are yellow.  Remove all of the numbers divisible by 3 that are white.
•	Sort the list ascending based on number and then color (Red < Yellow < White)
•	Display the results
